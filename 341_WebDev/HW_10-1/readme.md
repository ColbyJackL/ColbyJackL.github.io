I based this assignment heavily off of my personal website from the earlier assignment. I have added more images into the image folder but I want to figure out how to make the images go into a grid and be the correct size before I spend the time to resize all of them and add them to the home page. In the final Mobile website I would like to change the color pallette slightly and also make the images more compressed so I can put larger photos on that will still load fast. Overall this is a good base to continue off of but I need to also make the images not stretch. While it is messed up it does look a lot less bad in mobile format with the browser shrunk. I just need to get it to all properly expand to fit the desktop.
