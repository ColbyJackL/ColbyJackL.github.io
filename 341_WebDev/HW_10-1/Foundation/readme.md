I am not 100% Ready to turn this in for grading yet but I wanted to get it uploaded.
I still need to change the color scheme,, round some edges, change the fonts. I also want to make the hero section fit properly across all (or most of) the available pixels.
If I can figure it out i want each of the three photos at the bottom to open up a drop down section filled with a bunch more photos (like 10) of designs I have done for that brand, if not I will just link them to separate pages with the header and the images I want.
I also want to make a very simple about me page with a paragraph about me, my education, and my skills. This page will be very short and may not even require the user to scroll.

Overall I have a good outline I just need to get into it more and refine some parts so that they are working the way that I want.
