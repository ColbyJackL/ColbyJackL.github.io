I enjoyed this CSS project as it really shows how it is possible to bring a very short and simple html document to life. I had a little trouble with the font path, but we got that figured out after a quick meeting. 
I decided to go with a simple home page for myself that just showed a couple examples of art I have done recently, which motivated me a little more to make it look good I think.
