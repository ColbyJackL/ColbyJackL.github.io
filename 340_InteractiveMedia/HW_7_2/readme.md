This PacMan assignement was definately a big challenge. I was able to get the basis working But I had trouble with the collision function once I moved it from the "sketch" to the "pacman" js file.
I also had trouble with the mouth movement because I hard coded a lot of my Pacmen directions. I probably would not have been able to complete this assignment fully had I not gone in and gotten help! 
In the end it looks clean, the mouths move, and they dont go through each other, so I'm happy with how it turned out!
