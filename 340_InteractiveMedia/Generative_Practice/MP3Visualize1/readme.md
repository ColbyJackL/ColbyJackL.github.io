For this project I decided to make something interesting with sound. I made a frequency analyzer and visualizer. I wanted to make an upload section so the user could choose the song but I ran into major problems when I tried this. I decided to stick with what I knew worked for the final project so I have a sample song saved in the directory.
This song can easily be changed in one line of code but I couldn't get it to work with an upload function. Overall my frequency analyzer will scan different frequencies and their amplitudes onto different bars making a very cool audio visualizer.
In the end I like how it looked. If I had more experience and confidence in coding I would have loved to make the color spectrum randomly change to different spectrum colors and even background colors. Right now it is red-yellow spectrum with a black background but I would like it to change to maybe a green-blue with a teal background, purple-pink with a blue background, etc. 
It looks cool now but if I were to add anything that would make it awesome I think. 
I also wish that I was able to make the entire thing resive with the window so that if I drag the window big or small it responds and fits the screen perfectly. I had a lot of trouble getting the toggle button to appear where I wanted and to not be the default button style. I ended up having to translate the button and then using a little bit of CSS to style the button so it blended more with the background and didnt stand out as a default html button, but as a part of the canvas. I settled on making it a big plain grey font so it is obvious but not overpowering.
