For this project I am going to attempt to make an interesting audio visualizer. I am going to use different frequencies to put together an audio spectrum that displays a visualization of the song that is playing. I think it is going to be challenging to map different frequencies and amplitudes to different shapes and colors and make it look good but I'm hoping to make something that represents an audio spectrum, with the different frequencies mapped across the X-axis and the different amplitudes mapped to the Y. By December I need to have a good basis down for how to import audio and hopefully a start on the visualization. The following weeks will be spent tweaking and attempting to perfect the audio visualizer's looks and aesthetic.
