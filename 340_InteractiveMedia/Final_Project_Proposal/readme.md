For this project I am going to attempt to make a live updating "wind map", specifially of the state of Montana.
I will most likely use NOAA for the data, unless I find there is a better source while I am working on it.
I will use https://earth.nullschool.net/ and http://hint.fm/wind/ for reference but will likely run into some problems along the way.
On top of that once I figure out how to properly get the Montana data repeatedly, I have to figure out how to make the data display in a cool way. (Hopefully it will turn out as cool as the examples that inspired me)
