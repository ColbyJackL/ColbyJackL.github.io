This assignment went about half good and half bad. I was able to fufill all of the parameters of the assignment but it isnt very pretty. Hopefully next week I can make something visually apprealing, not just technically complete the assignment. The videos posted online help a lot but I still needed help in person to get my button working. I'm starting to feel more comfortable in JavaScript, definately an improvement over knowing absolutely nothing a couple weeks ago.
