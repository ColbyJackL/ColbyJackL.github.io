This weeks assignment with very smooth. I used the examples you posted online and expanded upon those using a shark theme. I was able to get everything working with little to no issues. The one thing I had trouble with at first was the host video, it wouldnt appear, but after I made the file smaller it showed up. GitHub must have a limit for video hosting. HTML is very interesting, but I think it'll be a lot better when combined with CSS to look less bland.
