This week was surprisingly confusing for what it was. I expected reorganizing my elements would be easy but I got too many errors so I just started fresh. I made a bouncing ball consolidated into three separate functions. All responsible for a different aspect of the balls action. I also made a replicatable ice cream cone usuing a function, so now it can be easily reproduced in different areas of the canvas without typing all the eparate pieces out again. This is very useful to keep your code organized, especially once we start working with longer code.
